# TERMINAL

## About the Terminal 

I took the intial idea from this 
[StackOverflow answer](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned?cb=1)
but it is not finished.

What I am looking to do is have a terminal inside of a 
JPane so as to facilitate easy command access during 
the use of the IDE. Much like we have in the lower
pane of the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

Currently, there are a few bugs with the output of the 
console which I would like to fix:
- [ ] Add the preamble to the user command (user/directory)
- [ ] Well formatted output
- [ ] A cursor

In the future it would be nice if we could just integrate
the native terminal into the program, but so far I am
not sure how to accomplish that.
